## 11/2/2025 - Brainstorming!    

spent about 30min brainstorming the layout and features for my consel.

I'm going to make a hadheld gaming consel for kids to code games on,
Heres what it will have

- 4 buttons on one side
- 1 joystick on the other
- 2 triggers buttons, one on each side
- An LCD screen in the middle, to display the game
- 1-slot for a SD card that holds a game on it

The inside will have

- A battery with about 1hour of power
- And an 8-bit processor

The frame is 3D printed and the inside is all one board
I might add a wifi or radio so you can play with friends

sorry that the image is rotated :(
